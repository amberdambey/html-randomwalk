HTML Random Walk
----------------

Made with HTML & JavaScript, standalone (No .css or .js files needed)
This is a simple project which I used to generate fire textures for a game I'm currently working on. It is very primitive at the moment.

Right-click to refresh, left-click to enable mouse auto-hide
Color modes:
R/G: Fire
G/R: Green-to-yellow
G/B: Emerald-like color
B/G: Ice/Water
B/R: Crystal-like color
R/B: Ruby-like color
Color mode is selected randomly upon refresh
This is one of my first ever JavaScript projects, so it isn't the best!
