HTML Random Walk Trail Simulator
--------------------------------

A point within a grid moves between adjacent cells. It can move up, down, left, or right. Every iteration, the cell it is currently at changes color by increasing a specific color channel, red, green, or blue, determined upon reloading the page.

Made with HTML & JavaScript, standalone (No .css or .js files needed)
This is a simple project which I used to generate fire textures for a game I'm currently working on. It is very primitive at the moment.

Right-click to refresh, left-click to enable mouse auto-hide

The page automatically refreshes when the density of a cell exceeds 20.

Color modes:

R/G: Fire

G/R: Green-to-yellow

G/B: Emerald-like color

B/G: Ice/Water

B/R: Crystal-like color

R/B: Ruby-like color

Currently, there is no user interface. As such, color mode is selected randomly upon refresh.

This is one of my first ever JavaScript projects, so it isn't the best, yet!

I suggest you read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) for more info.
